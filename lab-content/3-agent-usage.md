# Start Using the Agents!

Congratuations! by now you must have a working orchestration with a Manager Agent controlling 3 Sub Agents. 

You can take a look at the orchestration [here](https://studio.lyzr.ai/lyzr-manager). You can use this space to Modify Agent - Sub Agent behaviour too!

You can now choose to use the agent on the studio or launch the agent for the world to see. (More on launching in the upcoming sections)

## Testing an agent

For the intents of this workshop, Test your Manager Agent with the following prompts.

1. Track the status of an order -> “Where is my order AWSPET-20018?”
2. Check return eligibility -> “Can I return this leash?”
3. Get product details -> “Tell me more about the nylon bone chew toy”

When you are confident with its performance, Make sure to participate in the leaderboards.
<!-- add activity to score --> 

## Scoring

After completing your workshop, participants will access a simple web
form to submit their work for scoring.

Enter two required parameters: your Lyzr Account API key and the
Agent ID of your deployed Manager Agent.

The system will automatically evaluate your agents against test cases
covering all user stories, agent quality, guardrails, and Bedrock
integration.

Make sure to submit via the form so your score can be recorded,
displayed on the leaderboard, and eligible for prizes.

Scores reflect multi-agent orchestration success, response quality, tool
usage accuracy, and adherence to isolation/privacy best practices.

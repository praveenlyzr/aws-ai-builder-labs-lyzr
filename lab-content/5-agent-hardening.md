## Hardening an Agent

The [Agent Simulation Engine](https://studio.lyzr.ai/agent-simulation-engine/) is Lyzr's solution to ensure that any agent built on Lyzr can be its best version possible. This helps you simulate different world models with different perspective making sure there are no edge cases left untested. Post simulation, the results can be used to continously harden the Agents, ensuring the Agent being capable of handling any situation it may find itself in.
